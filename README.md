# Robot Challenge Solutions (Java) ðŸ¤–

This project contains solutions to coding test problems solved using Java17 in IntelliJ.



## Adding Robots
You can add new robot by modifying(or adding) the 'robots' list in the 'main' function of the 'Main.java' file.
Each robot is represented by a String[ ][ ] 2D array of strings containing its position and directions.
<br/>
<b><u>To add a new robot, please follow the format below..ðŸ˜Š</u></b>
<br/>
<b>Example) robots.add(new String[ ] [ ] { {position}, {directions} };</b> <br/>
- robots.add(new String[ ] [ ] { {"1", "1", "E"}, {"R","F","R","F","R","F","R","F"} }<br/>
- The first array represents the initial position of the robot : 1 1 E  <br/>
- The second array represents its direction(movement) instructions : R F R F R F R F <br/>

You can add robots as much as you can..

## Running the Program
When you run this program, you will see the final positions and directions of each robot printed out.
Each line corresponds to the final position and direction of a robot.<br/>
