## Adding Robots
You can add new robot by modifying(or adding) the 'robots' list in the 'main' function of the 'Main.java' file.
Each robot is represented by a String[ ][ ] 2D array of strings containing its position and directions.
<br/>
<b><u>To add a new robot, please follow the format below..ðŸ˜Š</u></b>
<br/>
<b>Example) robots.add(new String[ ] [ ] { {position}, {directions} };</b> <br/>
- robots.add(new String[ ] [ ] { {"1", "1", "E"}, {"R","F","R","F","R","F","R","F"} }<br/>
- The first array represents the initial position of the robot : 1 1 E  <br/>
- The second array represents its direction(movement) instructions : R F R F R F R F <br/>

You can add robots as much as you can..
